# üõ°Ô∏è Computer Vision for Public Safety

Computer Vision can be used to enhance public safety by automatically detecting and alerting authorities to potentially dangerous situations in real-time. This repository contains multiple Python-based solutions powered by YOLO, OpenCV, and other deep learning tools for real-time surveillance and safety analysis.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository includes the following computer vision solutions:

| Code | Module Name                     | Description                                                                 |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **PPE Suit Detection**           | Detects whether workers are wearing white safety suits on the field.       |
| 2    | **Construction Site Safety**     | Monitors helmet usage, vest detection, and overall worker safety.          |
| 3    | **Speed Monitoring**             | Tracks vehicle speed using object tracking and flags overspeeding.         |
| 4    | **Intrusion Detection**          | Detects unauthorized entry in restricted areas using ROI-based detection.  |
| 5    | **Crowd Detection**              | Identifies and analyzes overcrowded areas for risk assessment.             |
| 6    | **Camera Tampering Detection**   | Detects tampering activities like occlusion, defocus, or movement.         |
